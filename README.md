### Gradients

To use a gradient, you need to wrap the wavy divider in a group block and apply the gradient to the group block. After that, create a wavy shape and apply a color that matches your content background (e.g. white). You can then switch the direction of the divider (under settings) to give a mirrored effect. This way the gradient is applied to the group block and the wavy divider acts as a mask.

### Group Block

If nesting the wavy divider in a group block, you may want to remove the padding and margins so that the wavy divider will not have spacing around it. To handle this, select the group block, and under "Advanced" (at the bottom of the settings area) add these two classes:

- `wavy-divider-remove-margin`
- `wavy-divider-remove-padding`

### Patterns

Within the block inserter, under the Patterns tab, select 'Wavy Divider' from the dropdown menu to view some special, custom-made wavy patterns. And depending on the time of year, seasonal designs too!
