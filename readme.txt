= Gradients =

To use a gradient, you need to wrap the wavy divider in a group block and apply the gradient to the group block. After that, create a wavy shape and apply a color that matches your content background (e.g. white). You can then switch the direction of the divider (under settings) to give a mirrored effect. This way the gradient is applied to the group block and the divider acts as a mask.

= Group Block =

If nesting the wavy divider in a group block, you may want to remove the padding and margins so that the wavy divider will not have spacing around it. To handle this, select the group block, and under "Advanced" add these two classes:

wavy-divider-remove-margin
wavy-divider-remove-padding
